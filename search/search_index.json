So I looked into other options and using an arduino to control an IR LED that tells the camera when to take photos seemed like the best option. My main source for this project was from Bayesian Adventures . This covered most of the ground work for getting the arduino to trigger the camera. I then added more functionality with an OLED screen, a menu system and more features. This project is quite old and therefore the code is a bit of a mess. So the code probably won't be put online and anyway the source linked above has all the information needed to make your own.
